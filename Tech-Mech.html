                        <p>Mechanical, electrical, and plumbing (MEP) refers to these aspects of building design and construction. In commercial buildings these aspects are often designed by an engineering firm specializing in MEP. Mechanical engineers often design and oversees the heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC), plumbing, and rain gutter systems. Plumbing designers often include design specifications for simple active fire protection systems, but for more complicated projects, fire protection engineers are often separately retained. Electrical engineers are responsible for the building's power distribution, telecommunication, fire alarm, signalization, lightning protection and control systems, as well as lighting systems.</p>

                        <p>MEP design is important for design decision-making, accurate documentation, performance and cost-estimation, construction planning, managing and operating the resulting facility. This course explains the fundamentals involved in such a designing process.</p>

                    <p>Non-destructive testing(NDT) is a wide group of analysis techniques used in science and technology industry to evaluate the properties of a material, component or system without causing damage. The terms non-destructive examination (NDE), non-destructive inspection (NDI), and non-destructive evaluation (NDE) are also commonly used to describe this technology. NDT is commonly used in forensic engineering, mechanical engineering, petroleum engineering, electrical engineering, civil engineering, systems engineering, aeronautical engineering, medicine, and art. Analyzing and documenting a non-destructive failure mode can also be accomplished using a high-speed camera recording continuously (movie-loop) until the failure is detected.</p>

                    <p>Detecting the failure can be accomplished using a sound detector or stress gauge which produces a signal to trigger the high-speed camera. These high-speed cameras have advanced recording modes to capture some non-destructive failures. After the failure the high-speed camera will stop recording. The capture images can be played back in slow motion showing precisely what happen before, during and after the non-destructive event, image by image.</p>

                    <p>NDT is used in a variety of settings that covers a wide range of industrial activity, with new NDT methods and applications, being continuously developed. Non-destructive testing methods are routinely applied in industries where a failure of a component would cause significant hazard or economic loss, such as in transportation, pressure vessels, building structures, piping, and hoisting equipment.</p>

                        <p>Petroleum engineering is a field of engineering concerned with the activities related to the production of hydrocarbons, which can be either crude oil or natural gas.Exploration and production are deemed to fall within the upstream sector of the oil and gas industry. Exploration, by earth scientists, and petroleum engineering are the oil and gas industry's two main subsurface disciplines, which focus on maximizing economic recovery of hydrocarbons from subsurface reservoirs. Petroleum geology and geophysics focus on provision of a static description of the hydrocarbon reservoir rock, while petroleum engineering focuses on estimation of the recoverable volume of this resource using a detailed understanding of the physical behavior of oil, water and gas within porous rock at very high pressure.</p>

                        <p>The combined efforts of geologists and petroleum engineers throughout the life of a hydrocarbon accumulation determine the way in which a reservoir is developed and depleted, and usually they have the highest impact on field economics. Petroleum engineering requires a good knowledge of many other related disciplines, such as geophysics, petroleum geology, formation evaluation (well logging), drilling, economics, reservoir simulation, reservoir engineering, well engineering, artificial lift systems, completions and petroleum production engineering.</p>

                        <p>Petroleum engineers divide themselves into several types:</p>

                        <ul>

                                Reservoir Engineers: work to optimize production of oil and gas via proper placement, production rates, and enhanced oil recovery techniques.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Drilling Engineers: manage the technical aspects of drilling exploratory, production and injection wells.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Completion Engineers: (also known as subsurface engineers) work to design and oversee the implementation of techniques aimed at ensuring wells are drilled stably and with the maximum opportunity for oil and gas production.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Production Engineers: manage the interface between the reservoir and the well, including perforations, sand control, downhole flow control, and downhole monitoring equipment; evaluate artificial lift methods; and select surface equipment that separates the produced fluids (oil, natural gas, and water).
                            </li>

                        <p>QA/QC is the combination of quality assurance, the process or set of processes used to measure and assure the quality of a product, and quality control, the process of ensuring products and services meet consumer expectations.Quality assurance is process oriented and focuses on defect prevention, while quality control is product oriented and focuses on defect identification.The term "control", however, is used to describe the fifth phase of the Define, Measure, Analyze, Improve, Control (DMAIC) model. DMAIC is a data-driven quality strategy used to improve processes.</p>

                        <p>The terms "quality assurance" and "quality control" are often used interchangeably to refer to ways of ensuring the quality of a service or product.For instance, the term "assurance" is often used as follows: Implementation of inspection and structured testing as a measure of quality assurance in a television set software project at Philips Semiconductors is described.</p>

                        <p>Quality control, or QC for short, is a process by which entities review the quality of all factors involved in production.This approach places an emphasis on three aspects:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                Elements such as controls, job management, defined and well managed processes,performance and integrity criteria, and identification of records.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Competence, such as knowledge, skills, experience, and qualifications.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Soft elements, such as personnel, integrity, confidence, organizational culture, motivation, team spirit, and quality relationships.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Inspection is a major component of quality control, where physical product is examined visually (or the end results of a service are analyzed). Product inspectors will be provided with lists and descriptions of unacceptable product defects such as cracks or surface blemishes.</p>

                        <p>Weld quality assurance is the use of technological methods and actions to test or assure the quality of welds, and secondarily to confirm the presence, location and coverage of welds.In manufacturing, welds are used to join two or more metal surfaces. Because these connections may encounter loads and fatigue during product lifetime, there is a chance they may fail if not created to proper specification.Methods of weld testing and analysis are used to assure the quality and correctness of the weld after it is completed. This term generally refers to testing and analysis focused on the quality and strength of the weld, but may refer to technological actions to check for the presence, position and extent of welds.These are divided into destructive and non-destructive methods.</p>

                        <p>A few examples of destructive testing include macro etch testing, fillet-weld break tests, transverse tension tests, and guided bend tests.Other destructive methods include acid etch testing, back bend testing, tensile strength break testing, nick break testing, and free bend testing.</p>

                        <p>SIP provides the basis for the WeldPrint system, which consists of a front-end interface and software based on the SIP engine and relies on electrical signals alone. It is designed to be non-intrusive and sufficiently robust to withstand harsh industrial welding environments. The first major purchaser of the technology,provided feedback that allowed the system to be refined in ways that increased its industrial and commercial value. Improvements in the algorithms, including multiple parameter optimization with a server network, have led to an order-of-magnitude improvement in fault-detection performance over the past five years.</p>
